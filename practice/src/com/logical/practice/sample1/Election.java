/**
 * A group of students are sitting in a circle. The teacher is electing a new
 * class president. The teacher does this by singing a song while walking around
 * the circle. After the song is finished the student at which the teacher
 * stopped is removed from the circle.
 * 
 * Starting at the student next to the one that was just removed, the teacher
 * resumes singing and walking around the circle. After the teacher is done
 * singing, the next student is removed. The teacher repeats this until only one
 * student is left.
 *
 * A song of length k will result in the teacher walking past k students on each
 * round. The students are numbered 1 to n. The teacher starts at student 1.
 * 
 * For example, suppose the song length is two (k=2). And there are four
 * students to start with (1,2,3,4). The first student to go would be `2`, after
 * that `4`, and after that `3`. Student `1` would be the next president in this
 * example.
 *
 * @param n the number of students sitting in a circle.
 * @param k the length (in students) of each song.
 * @return the number of the student that is elected.
